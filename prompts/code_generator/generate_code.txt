Generate Python code for a project based on the following specification and diagrams:

Specification:
{spec}

Diagrams:
{diagrams}

Requirements:
1. Create a file for each class in the specification
2. Create a main.py file that imports and uses these classes
3. Add proper type hints, docstrings, and logging
4. Include clear, maintainable code structure
5. Create a requirements.txt file with necessary dependencies
6. Create a README.md with installation and usage instructions

Respond with a JSON structure containing:
{
    "filename1.py": "file content",
    "filename2.py": "file content",
    "main.py": "file content",
    "requirements.txt": "requirements content",
    "README.md": "readme content"
}

Important: Only include the JSON output, without any explanation or additional text.
Use proper Python-specific code formatting with correct indentation.
